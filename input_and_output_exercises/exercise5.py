# First thing I will do is create an empty list, so it can be populated with numbers
# After that, I will make a range to 5 and loop through it and each loop will prompt
# the user to enter a number
# When the user inputs their numbers, those numbers will be appended to the empty list made in the beginning


# Declaring a new list
