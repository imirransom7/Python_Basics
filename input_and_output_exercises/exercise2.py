Exercise 2: Display three string "Name", "Is", "James" as

"Name**Is*James"

# To get the names to print out like the example above, I will use the print function
# so that there are three strings and add the sep= method to split them up with
# delimiter if asterisks ("**")

print("Name", "Is", "James", sep="**")
