Exercise 5: Check if the first and last number of a list is the same

Write a function to return True if the first and last number of a given list is same. If numbers are
different then return False.
"""

# I will begin by writing in a function that takes in two lists and returns a boolean
# Then, I will compare the two lists by using slicing to check the first and last number are equal
# To make it short and concise, I will just return the two lists with the equals operator between them

def first_and_last1(list1, List[int], list2: List[int]) -> boolean:
  return lis1t[0] == list2[-1]
