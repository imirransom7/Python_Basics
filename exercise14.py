Exercise 14: Print a downward Half-Pyramid Pattern of Star
(asterisk)
"""

# I will create a function that will take in a number and print out a down Half-Pyramid Patter of Star
# I will then create a for loop that decrements the number given until it reaches 0.
# To get the star pattern, I will multiply the current number with a string asterisk: "*" so that
# I that the same number of stars will print out
