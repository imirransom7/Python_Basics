For example, suppose the taxable income is 45000, and the income tax payable is

10000*0% + 10000*10%  + 25000*20% = $6000.
"""

# I am going to create a fuction that will take in one number as the parameter and return on number
# Then, I will implement the equation used above. I will do (20,000 - num)*20% since I need the remainder
# of the money after the first and second 10,000 used in the equation. Then, I will return the answer
