# Starting with creating my function that will take in two strings as parameters that returns a string
# Next will be taking s1 and s2's first letter by using [0] and adding them together. Then I will get
# the middle character by dividing the length of the string by two and flooring it, then add them together.
# After that, I will get the last letters from both by using [-1] and then add them
