Exercise 7: String characters balance Test

Write a program to check if two strings are balanced. For example, strings s1 and s2 are balanced if
all the characters in the s1 and s2. The character's position doesn't matter

Given:

Case 1:                                                     Case 2:
s1 = "Yn"                                                   s1 = "Ynf"
s2 = "PYnative"                                             s2 = "PYnative"

Expected Output:                                            Expected Output:
True                                                        False
