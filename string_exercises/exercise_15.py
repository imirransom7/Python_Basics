"""

# To start, I will create a function that will take in a string as a parameter and return a string
# Then, I will convert the string into a list using the split method splitting by the spaces found in 
# the string. Then I will use a condition while the list is being iterated through to check if elements
# are letters or symbols. Then I will use the join() method to convert the list back into a string


def no_symbols(str1: str) -> str:
  pass
