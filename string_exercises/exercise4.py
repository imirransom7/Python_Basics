Exercise 4: Arrange the string characters such that lowercase letters
should come first

Given string contains a combination of the lower and upper case letters. Write a program ro
arrange the characters of a string so that lowercase letters should come first
"""

# I will start by making a function that takes in a string as a parameter that returns a string
# Then I will check for the string's lowercase letters and save it to a variable, and do the same
# for the uppercase letters to a different variable. After that is done, all that is needed is to concatenate
# them both together, making sure the lowercase letters are first
