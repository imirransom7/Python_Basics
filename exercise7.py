# I will create a function that will take in a string and returns a number
# I will create a variable that will hold counter to count the amount of times 'Emma' shows up
# To find how many times 'Emma' is in a substring, I will convert the string into a list
#  with a delimeter of spaces, to then iterate though it and see which elements, substrings, have 
# Emma as a substring. Next, is to increment the counter everytime Emma is a substring and then return
# that counter
